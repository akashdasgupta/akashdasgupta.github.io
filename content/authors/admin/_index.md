  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a researcher with a passion for advancing renewable energy technologies, particularly in the field of perovskite solar cells. Originally from India and raised in the UK, I developed a deep curiosity for science early on, which led me to pursue a Master's in Physics at the University of Bristol and a PhD at the University of Oxford. Throughout my academic journey, I have cultivated expertise in designing cutting-edge measurement systems and have become proficient in a unique combination of instrumentation, advanced data analysis, and computational methods. My research is driven by a commitment to solving critical challenges in solar energy, including stability and scalability, to push renewable technologies closer to widespread market adoption. Beyond my research, I am passionate about outreach and mentoring, particularly for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, as I believe in the transformative power of education and science.
