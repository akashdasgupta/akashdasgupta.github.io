  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a final year PhD student who is passionate about physics, especially in measurement systems, and am excited to embark on the next stage of my career in the field of Perovskite solar cells. I am skilled in setting up optical systems including laser systems and imaging systems, and am fluent in python and C++. I am hard working, and enjoy tackling unsolved problems, and developing novel characterisation techniques, which enable us to gain insights that were not possible before. Coming from a school where many of my peers did not have the means or motivation to peruse higher education, I am passionate about outreach, striving to inspire a love for physics in the younger generation
