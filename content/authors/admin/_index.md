  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I'm a researcher specializing in advanced characterization and metrology, with a focus on solving complex problems across various fields, from renewable energy to emerging technologies. Originally from India, I moved to the UK at a young age, where I earnt a Master's degree in Physics from the University of Bristol and pursue a PhD at Oxford. My work bridges the gap between designing innovative measurement systems, data analysis, and computational modeling to drive new technologies towards real-world applications. With a strong foundation in physics and hands-on experience in developing cutting-edge tools, I am dedicated to advancing technology through precision and innovation. Iâ€™m passionate about making science accessible through outreach and mentoring, especially for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, inspired by my own journey.
