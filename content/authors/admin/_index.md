  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

- Hi! I’m a researcher passionate about tackling tough challenges in everything from renewable energy to cutting-edge tech. I’m especially interested in designing measurement systems and analysis techniques that allow us to acquire and process data in ways we couldn’t before—finding new ways to pull more insights about the physical world. Originally from India, I grew up in the UK, studied Physics at Bristol, and have nearly completed my PhD at Oxford. I’m also interested in making science more accessible, especially for students from disadvantaged backgrounds—I know how much that support can matter! When I’m not in the lab, you can find me sketching with pencils, pens, or watercolours (still very much an amateur!).
