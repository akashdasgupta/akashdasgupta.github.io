  abstract  = "AbstractTwo dimensional/three‐dimensional (2D/3D) metal halide
               perovskite heterostructures have attracted great interest in
               photovoltaic and light‐emitting diode (LEDs) applications. In
               both, their implementation results in an improvement in device
               efficiency yet the understanding of these heterostructures
               remains incomplete. In this work the role of organic cations,
               essential for the formation of 2D perovskite structures is
               unraveled, in a range of metal halide perovskite
               heterostructures. These heterostructures are used to fabricate
               efficient green perovskite LEDs and a strong dependence between
               cation content and device performance is shown. The crystal
               structure, charge‐carrier transport and dynamics, and the
               electronic structure of these heterostructures are studied and it
               is shown that the presence of crystalline 2D perovskite inhibits
               electron injection and ultimately lowers device performance. This
               work highlights the importance of optimizing the composition of
               these heterostructures in ensuring optimal device performance
               across all parameters and suggests that developing routes to
               inject charge‐carriers directly into 2D perovskite structures
               will be important in ensuring the continued development of
               perovskite LEDs based on these heterostructures.",
