  abstract  = "In this work, we couple theoretical and experimental approaches
               to understand and reduce the losses of wide bandgap Br-rich
               perovskite pin devices at open-circuit voltage (VOC) and
               short-circuit current (JSC) conditions. A mismatch between the
               internal quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) and the external VOC
               is detrimental for these devices. We demonstrate that modifying
               the perovskite top-surface with guanidinium-Br and imidazolium-Br
               forms a low-dimensional perovskite phase at the n-interface,
               suppressing the QFLS-VOC mismatch, and boosting the VOC.
               Concurrently, the use of an ionic interlayer or a self-assembled
               monolayer at the p-interface reduces the inferred field screening
               induced by mobile ions at JSC, promoting charge extraction and
               raising the JSC. The combination of the n- and p-type
               optimizations allows us to approach the thermodynamic potential
               of the perovskite absorber layer, resulting in …",
