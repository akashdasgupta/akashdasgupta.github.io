  abstract  = "The efficiency and longevity of metal-halide perovskite solar
               cells are typically dictated by nonradiative defect-mediated
               charge recombination. In this work, we demonstrate a vapor-based
               amino-silane passivation that reduces photovoltage deficits to
               around 100 millivolts (>90\% of the thermodynamic limit) in
               perovskite solar cells of bandgaps between 1.6 and 1.8 electron
               volts, which is crucial for tandem applications. A primary-,
               secondary-, or tertiary-amino-silane alone negatively or barely
               affected perovskite crystallinity and charge transport, but
               amino-silanes that incorporate primary and secondary amines yield
               up to a 60-fold increase in photoluminescence quantum yield and
               preserve long-range conduction. Amino-silane-treated devices
               retained 95\% power conversion efficiency for more than 1500
               hours under full-spectrum sunlight at 85Â°C and open-circuit
               conditions in ambient air with a relative humidity of 50 to 60\%.",
