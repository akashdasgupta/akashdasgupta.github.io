  abstract  = "Although significant progress has been made in the development of
               green, red, and near-infrared perovskite light-emitting diodes
               (PeLEDs), blue PeLEDs exhibit inferior performance, owing to
               various defects and poor carrier injection in solution-processed
               perovskite films. Thus, this study incorporates dual-passivation
               additive diphenylphosphinamide (DPPA) into perovskite films, and
               through density functional theory calculations and experimental
               characterizations, DPPA has been proven to be an effective
               passivator. Its phosphine oxide group coordinates with
               unsaturated lead ions, passivating perovskite defects, while the
               amino group forms hydrogen bonds with adjacent halide ions,
               suppressing their migration and further strengthening the
               passivation effect. Blue quasi-two-dimensional PeLEDs based on
               DPPA-modified perovskite films achieved an external quantum
               efficiency of 12.31\% with an emission peak at 486 nm. Moreover,
               the device operational lifetime was extended by 32\% with more
               stable spectra owing to the decreased defect density and
               suppressed ion migration in the perovskite film.",
