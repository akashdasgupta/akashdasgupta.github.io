  abstract  = "AbstractMixed lead‐tin (Pb:Sn) halide perovskites are promising
               absorbers with narrow‐bandgaps (1.25–1.4 eV) suitable for
               high‐efficiency all‐perovskite tandem solar cells. However,
               solution processing of optimally thick Pb:Sn perovskite films is
               notoriously difficult in comparison with their neat‐Pb
               counterparts. This is partly due to the rapid crystallization of
               Sn‐based perovskites, resulting in films that have a high degree
               of roughness. Rougher films are harder to coat conformally with
               subsequent layers using solution‐based processing techniques
               leading to contact between the absorber and the top metal
               electrode in completed devices, resulting in a loss of VOC, fill
               factor, efficiency, and stability. Herein, this study employs a
               non‐continuous layer of alumina nanoparticles distributed on the
               surface of rough Pb:Sn perovskite films. Using this approach, the
               conformality of the subsequent electron‐transport layer, which is
               only tens of nanometres in thickness is improved. The overall
               maximum‐power‐point‐tracked efficiency improves by 65\% and the
               steady‐state VOC improves by 28\%. Application of the alumina
               nanoparticles as an interfacial buffer layer also results in
               highly reproducible Pb:Sn solar cell devices while simultaneously
               improving device stability at 65 °C under full spectrum simulated
               solar irradiance. Aged devices show a six‐fold improvement in
               stability over pristine Pb:Sn devices, increasing their lifetime
               to 120 h.",
