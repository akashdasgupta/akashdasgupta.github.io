  abstract = "Abstract Narrow bandgap mixed lead-tin perovskites are critical
              for efficient all-perovskite multi-junction solar cells, but their
              poor stability under operating conditions represents a major
              barrier to implementation. In this work, we explore the causes of
              this instability under combined heat and light stress (ISOS L-2
              conditions). The phase, absorbance, morphology, and background
              hole density in lead-tin perovskite films are observed to be
              stable beyond the usual timescales associated with device
              degradation. We measure a moderate increase in non-radiative
              recombination during stressing, but device simulations demonstrate
              that this can only account for a small portion of the observed
              steady-state performance loss. Variable rate current-voltage
              scanning of devices instead reveals an increasing impact of mobile
              ions to be the major cause of early-time performance degradation.
              This impact is found to be significantly mitigated by selecting an
              alternative hole transport layer. Over longer aging times, we also
              identify the growth of impurity phases as well as hole transport
              material-dependent changes in the electronic properties of the
              perovskite. By quantifying the impact of these changes on device
              performance, we identify the most dominant degradation pathway at
              each aging time for different device architectures, defining a
              clear direction for future stability improvements.",
