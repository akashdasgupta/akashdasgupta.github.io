  abstract  = "While amines are widely used as additives in metal-halide
               perovskites, our understanding of the way amines in perovskite
               precursor solutions impact the resultant perovskite film is still
               limited. In this paper, we explore the multiple effects of
               benzylamine (BnAm), also referred to as phenylmethylamine, used
               to passivate both FA0.75Cs0.25Pb(I0.8Br0.2)3 and FA0.8Cs0.2PbI3
               perovskite compositions. We show that, unlike benzylammonium
               (BnA+) halide salts, BnAm reacts rapidly with the formamidinium
               (FA+) cation, forming new chemical products in solution and these
               products passivate the perovskite crystal domains when processed
               into a thin film. In addition, when BnAm is used as a bulk
               additive, the average perovskite solar cell maximum power point
               tracked efficiency (for 30 s) increased to 19.3\% compared to the
               control devices 16.8\% for a 1.68 eV perovskite. Under combined
               full spectrum simulated sunlight and 65 Â°C temperature, the
               devices maintained a better T80 stability of close to 2500 h
               while the control devices have T80 stabilities of <100 h. We
               obtained similar results when presynthesizing the product BnFAI
               and adding it directly into the perovskite precursor solution.
               These findings highlight the mechanistic differences between
               amine and ammonium salt passivation, enabling the rational design
               of molecular strategies to improve the material quality and
               device performance of metal-halide perovskites.",
