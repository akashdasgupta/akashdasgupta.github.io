  abstract  = "Monolithic all-perovskite triple-junction solar cells have the
               potential to deliver power conversion efficiencies beyond those
               of state-of-art double-junction tandems and well beyond the
               detailed-balance limit for single junctions. Today, however,
               their performance is limited by large deficits in open-circuit
               voltage and unfulfilled potential in both short-circuit current
               density and fill factor in the wide-bandgap perovskite sub cell.
               Here we find that halide heterogeneity—present even immediately
               following materials synthesis—plays a key role in interfacial
               non-radiative recombination and collection efficiency losses
               under prolonged illumination for Br-rich perovskites. We find
               that a diammonium halide salt, propane-1,3-diammonium iodide,
               introduced during film fabrication, improves halide
               homogenization in Br-rich perovskites, leading to enhanced
               operating stability and a record open-circuit voltage of 1.44 V
