               realizing efficient and stable positive (p)-intrinsic
               (i)-negative (n) perovskite solar cells1,2, but it remains a
               critical challenge. Here, we report an effective method for
               producing high-quality, micron-thick formamidinium-based
               perovskite films by forming coherent grain boundaries, where
               high-Miller-index-oriented grains grow on the
               low-Miller-index-oriented grains in a stabilized atmosphere. The
               resulting micron-thick perovskite films, with enhanced grain
               boundaries and grains, showed stable material properties and
               outstanding optoelectronic performances. The small-area solar
               cells achieved efficiencies of 26.1\%. The 1-square-centimeter
               devices and 5 cm Ã— 5 cm minimodules delivered efficiencies of
               24.3\% and 21.4\%, respectively. The devices processed in a
               stabilized atmosphere presented a high reproducibility across all
               four seasons. The encapsulated devices exhibited superior
               long-term stability under both light and thermal stressors in
               ambient air.",
