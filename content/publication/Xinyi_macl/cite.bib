  abstract  = "Metal halide perovskite based tandem solar cells are promising to
               achieve power conversion efficiency beyond the theoretical limit
               of their single-junction counterparts. However, overcoming the
               significant open-circuit voltage deficit present in wide-bandgap
               perovskite solar cells remains a major hurdle for realizing
               efficient and stable perovskite tandem cells. Here, a holistic
               approach to overcoming challenges in 1.8 eV perovskite solar
               cells is reported by engineering the perovskite crystallization
               pathway by means of chloride additives. In conjunction with
               employing a self-assembled monolayer as the hole-transport layer,
               an open-circuit voltage of 1.25 V and a power conversion
               efficiency of 17.0\% are achieved. The key role of methylammonium
               chloride addition is elucidated in facilitating the growth of a
               chloride-rich intermediate phase that directs crystallization of
               the desired cubic perovskite phase and induces more effective
               halide homogenization. The as-formed 1.8 eV perovskite
               demonstrates suppressed halide segregation and improved
               optoelectronic properties.",
