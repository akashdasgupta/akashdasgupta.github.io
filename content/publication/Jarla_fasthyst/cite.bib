  abstract  = "AbstractThe presence of mobile ions in metal halide perovskites
               has been shown to adversely affect the intrinsic stability of
               perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the actual contribution
               of mobile ions to the total degradation loss compared with other
               factors such as trap-assisted recombination remains poorly
               understood. Here we reveal that mobile ion-induced internal field
               screening is the dominant factor in the degradation of PSCs under
               operational conditions. The increased field screening leads to a
               decrease in the steady-state efficiency, often owing to a large
               reduction in the current density. Instead, the efficiency at high
               scan speeds (>1,000 V s−1), where the ions are immobilized, is
               much less affected. We also show that the bulk and interface
               quality do not degrade upon ageing, yet the open-circuit voltage
               decreases owing to an increase in the mobile ion density. This
               work reveals the importance of ionic losses for intrinsic PSC
               degradation before chemical or extrinsic mechanical effects
               manifest.",
